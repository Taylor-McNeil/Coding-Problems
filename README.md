# 🧠 Algo Solutions

Welcome to my Grind Zone   
This repo contains my personal solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.

Whether I’m warming up with easy two-pointers or melting my brain on dynamic programming, I document it all here.



## ✨ Goals

- Build and maintain strong DSA fundamentals
- Solve problems in **Python** and whatever language I'm vibing with in the moment
- Track patterns & review performance over time
- Make future interviews less arduous


## 📚 Languages I’m Using
`Python` · `Java` 

(Might add `Rust` or `TS` later for pain and suffering reasons.)
